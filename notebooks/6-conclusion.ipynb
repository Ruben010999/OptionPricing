    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we developed a coherent quantitative framework for option pricing, risk measurement, strategy construction, and volatility trading under the Black–Scholes paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work progressed in a structured manner:\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Construction of static option strategies.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Black–Scholes Model: Structure and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black–Scholes model assumes that the underlying follows a geometric Brownian motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under risk-neutral valuation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS_t = r S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constant volatility $\\sigma$\n",
    "- Constant risk-free rate $r$\n",
    "- No transaction costs\n",
    "- Continuous trading\n",
    "- No jumps\n",
    "- Lognormal price distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The European call price is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(S_0, K, T) = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}, \\quad\n",
    "d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model provided the theoretical backbone for all subsequent analysis.\n",

    "## 3. Greeks and Risk Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "We computed and analyzed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delta: $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}$\n",
    "- Gamma: $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2}$\n",
    "- Vega: $\\nu = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma}$\n",
    "- Theta: $\\Theta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greeks allow local risk decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dV \\approx \\Delta dS + \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma dS^2 + \\Theta dt\n",

    "## 4. Static Option Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We constructed and analyzed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Protective put  \n",
    "- Covered call  \n",
    "- Bull call spread  \n",
    "- Long straddle  \n",

    "For each strategy we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computed Black–Scholes premiums,\n",
    "- Built payoff diagrams,\n",
    "- Derived P&L profiles at maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connected theoretical pricing with intuitive financial behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Dynamic Hedging and Gamma Scalping\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a discrete delta-hedging engine and simulated geometric Brownian motion paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a delta-hedged portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi_t = V_t - \\Delta_t S_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under continuous hedging, Black–Scholes implies perfect replication.  \n",
    "Under discrete hedging, P&L emerges from realized volatility differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If realized volatility $\\sigma_{real} > \\sigma_{imp}$,  \n",
    "  a long gamma (long straddle) strategy tends to generate positive P&L.\n",
    "- If realized volatility $\\sigma_{real} < \\sigma_{imp}$,  \n",
    "  the same strategy tends to generate negative P&L.\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms the theoretical relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[P\\&L] \\propto \\sigma_{imp}^2 - \\sigma_{real}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Volatility Arbitrage (Monte Carlo Evidence)\n",
    "\n",
    "To move beyond single-path illustrations, we conducted many-path Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined delta-hedged short straddles under two regimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\sigma_{imp} > \\sigma_{real}$  \n",
    "   → Positive expected P&L  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\sigma_{imp} < \\sigma_{real}$  \n",
    "   → Negative expected P&L  \n",
    "\n",
    "The distributional analysis confirmed that volatility trading is fundamentally a relative-value trade between implied and realized volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes the link between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Black–Scholes pricing,\n",
    "- Greeks,\n",
    "- Dynamic hedging,\n",
    "- Practical volatility arbitrage.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 7. Limitations of the Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its elegance, the Black–Scholes model has significant limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Volatility is not constant.  \n",
    "2. Markets exhibit jumps.  \n",
    "3. Volatility surfaces display skew and smile.  \n",
    "4. Hedging is discrete and costly.  \n",
    "5. Transaction costs and liquidity constraints matter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Realized volatility is stochastic.  \n",
    "- Implied volatility varies across strikes and maturities.  \n",
    "- Tail risk is underrepresented by lognormal dynamics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Black–Scholes model should be viewed as a foundational approximation rather than a complete market description.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Possible Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework can be extended in several directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic volatility models (e.g., Heston-type dynamics)  \n",
    "- Jump-diffusion models  \n",
    "- Local volatility surfaces  \n",
    "- Variance swaps and volatility derivatives  \n",
    "- Transaction cost modeling  \n",
    "- Risk-neutral vs real-world measure separation  \n",
    "\n",
    "Such extensions would bridge classical option theory with modern quantitative finance practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Final Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was designed not merely as a coding exercise, but as a full conceptual journey through quantitative option theory — from mathematical foundations to trading intuition and simulated P&L.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began with the Black–Scholes differential equation and its closed-form solution, establishing the theoretical pricing structure under risk-neutral valuation. From there, we translated analytical formulas into numerical implementations, ensuring that every component — $d_1$, $d_2$, option value, and Greeks — was fully understood both mathematically and computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then moved from static valuation to risk decomposition. The Greeks transformed the pricing formula into a dynamic sensitivity framework. Instead of viewing an option as a static object, we interpreted it as a bundle of risk exposures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta$ — directional exposure  \n",
    "- $\\Gamma$ — convexity exposure  \n",
    "- $\\Theta$ — time decay  \n",
    "- $\\nu$ — volatility exposure  \n",
    "\n",
    "This naturally led to the next conceptual step: hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing a discrete delta-hedging engine and simulating geometric Brownian motion paths, we bridged the gap between theoretical replication and practical execution. The project clearly demonstrated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous hedging is a theoretical idealization.\n",
    "- Discrete hedging introduces residual P&L.\n",
    "- That residual P&L is fundamentally driven by the relationship between implied and realized volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gamma scalping experiments provided the key economic insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Volatility trading is a bet on } \\sigma_{real} \\text{ relative to } \\sigma_{imp}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Through single-path and many-path Monte Carlo simulations, we observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long gamma profits when realized volatility exceeds implied volatility.\n",
    "- Short gamma profits when implied volatility exceeds realized volatility.\n",
    "- The distribution of P&L reflects volatility mispricing rather than directional forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a central principle of modern derivatives markets:  \n",
    "options are instruments for structuring and transferring volatility risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the project also clarified the boundaries of the Black–Scholes world. Real markets exhibit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volatility smiles and skews,\n",
    "- Stochastic volatility,\n",
    "- Jumps,\n",
    "- Liquidity frictions,\n",
    "- Transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while the model is internally consistent and mathematically elegant, it is a first-order approximation of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broader perspective, this project unified:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic calculus,\n",
    "- Risk-neutral pricing,\n",
    "- Numerical simulation,\n",
    "- Strategy construction,\n",
    "- Hedging mechanics,\n",
    "- Statistical analysis of P&L distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It demonstrated how mathematical theory translates into trading logic, and how pricing models connect directly to risk management and volatility arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the project achieved three major goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Built a complete Black–Scholes pricing and Greeks engine.\n",
    "2. Connected static pricing to dynamic hedging.\n",
    "3. Demonstrated volatility trading mechanics through simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final outcome is a coherent quantitative framework that links theory, computation, and market intuition — forming a strong foundation for further exploration of advanced derivative models and real-world quantitative trading systems.\n"
